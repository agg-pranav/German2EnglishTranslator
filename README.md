# Seq2Seq 
### German to English Translator using pytorch Multi30k dataset

#### seq2seq.py: Used Encoder-Decoder Seq2Seq model
Metric used for evaluation: Bleu Score

Ways to improving model:-
- Using Attention  
- Use Transformers 
- Tuning Hyperparameters
- Increasing No. of Epochs
- Using Pre-trained Transformer model(Transfer Learning)

#### seq2seq_attn.py: Applied Attention to previous Seq2Seq model
Achieved Blue score of 25% with 50 epochs.

### transformers.py: Used Transformer model for machine translation
Achieved Blue score of 28.4% with 50 epochs


(*see code for hyperparameters used)
