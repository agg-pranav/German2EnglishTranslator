# Seq2Seq 
### German to English Translator using pytorch Multi30k dataset

#### seq2seq.py: Used Encoder-Decoder Seq2Seq model
Metric used for evaluation: Bleu Score

Ways to improving model:-
- Using Attention  
- Use Transformers  (*currently working)

### seq2seq_attn.py: Applied Attention to previous Seq2Seq model
Achieved Blue score of 25% with 50 epochs.
